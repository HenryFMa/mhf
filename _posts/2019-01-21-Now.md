# Now: The Global Serverless Platform

> [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co) is a cloud platform for serverless deployment. It enables developers to host websites and web services that deploy instantly, scale automatically, and require no supervision, all with minimal configuration.

> :seedling: **_Free - Pay after Growup_**

> :whale:**_Serverless_** here means:   
> * You as end/now user don't need to care about server
> * Sources are built into __output__ as [static files or serverless Lambdas](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/builds/#sources-and-outputs) __V2__

## Values
* _Serverless_
* _Immutable Multiple Deployments_
* _Builders(Diverse Programming Languages)_
* _CDN&DNS_
* _SSL(Automated Let's Encrypt)_
* _Github Integration_
* _Open Source_
* _See [official blog](https://zeit.co/blog/now-2) for detail_

> :partly_sunny: My experience with __Now__ is a bit messy, which I think is highly related to [the V1->V2 transition](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/platform/upgrade-to-2-0/).
> * :octocat: Please do share with @henryfma if you have better practical experience including V1.

## The Use Cases

---

### _[JSON-Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) for [GFF](https://gff.edening.net)_   
> * `"builds": [ { "src": "now/index.js", "use": "@now/node-server" } ]`   
> * You can take a look @[Huntings](https://gff-jsonserver-now.edening.net/huntings)   
> * Compared to using VPS directly, advantages are:   
> > * No cost and maintenance on _server_
> > * Simpler deployment process
> > * Automated SSL setup
> > * Automatic scaling with global distribution   
> * __Unfortunately, there's a gap on persistent storage.__   
> > :heavy_exclamation_mark:[__Not safe__ to be used as a file-based database](https://zeit.co/docs/v1/deployment-types/node#file-system-specifications)

### _Deploying and managing the server_peers of [the dWeb solutions](http://localhost:4000/2019/01/23/An-Exploration-of-the-Decentralized-World.html)_
* [Gun](https://github.com/amark/gun)

> `now --npm amark/gun`   
> Then visit the URL in the output of the 'now --npm' step, in your browser.   
> > :disappointed: It doesn't work, due to the official recommended v2 migration/upgrade, which is default/enforced to new users and hence a bit rude to me(a new user).   
> > > __NOTE: As of the 4th of January 2019, all new users will no longer be able to create deployments on the Now 1.0 platform version.__   
> > > `now -V 1.0 --npm amark/gun`   
> > > `Error! You tried to create a Now 1.0 deployment. Please use Now 2.0 instead`      
> > > __References:__
> > > * [Unable to deploy to 1.0](https://github.com/zeit/now-cli/issues/1805)   
> > > * [Now V1: Deploying Git Repositories](https://zeit.co/docs/v1/features/repositories/)   
> > > * [Now V2: Github Integration](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/)

> > :notes: After learning and trying the V2, stuff using :heavy_exclamation_mark:__WSS(WebSockets)__ such as Gun(and probably other dWeb solutions) hasn't been supported yet, until the __WSS__ support is released.
