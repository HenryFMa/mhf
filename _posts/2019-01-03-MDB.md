> __Quotes from official__   
> > __We operate in the freemium business model.__   
> >    
It means that the basic version of our product is available for free. You have to pay for the extended version.
> >    
In order to properly understand of our method used to acquire the first clients, you have to remember __two things:__   
1. We did not run direct sales
2. We did not promote directly the paid version of our product
> >    
In an open source environmental, advertising of anything what is paid, is threaten with an immediate ban and getting the spam label.
> >    
__In such circumstances it was essential for us (and still is) to promote our free version of MDB.__ The way we ran the promotion of this version in the first months was described in the previous article.
> >    
The only way that we used to convey the advertising information about our paid version, it is retargeting. This issue is described in the next sections."
